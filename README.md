About Farmax

Farmax is a totally Offline application developed by Omkar Jadhav (B & C). It is dedicated to all the farmers. The app provides an offline farming guide for almost 40 most dominant crops of India. This includes the Rabi, Kharif crops and even some Zaid crops. The guide includes the proper growth requirement for the crop as well as the Fertilisers and Manures required for the crop. Further, the app also gives information about the various farming helplines ( phone numbers) and farming experts from whom the farmers can seek help by calling them. This was the information part which was freeware. Morever the app also includes Farmax (BlueTooth) terminal which gives the data information about the soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH level of the soil and accordingly, if these levels are not up to the mark, an automatic water pump would water the plants. The system would activate two times in a day. The app would automatically set alarms to your phone about these timings. The farmer has to be ready with the phone in his hands prior to the initialisation of the system and connect the farming device with bluetooth which would give the real time information through digital display on the mobile phone. If at all, the farmer fails to check it.. Or his farm is away and he cant get bluetooth connectivity, or the farmer has literacy problems, the System would send an SMS to the phone. The app has an inbuilt offline farming assistant so that the farmer can atleast hear and interpret.
The only motive of Farmax is to help the farmers in some way or the other. First of all it provides the farming guide in offline mode, this overshadows the connectivity problems. Secondly it provides the toll free numbers and contacts of farming experts whom the farmers are deprived to be known off. Third the Farmax farming system helps to save water, as well as time of the farmers, in a very efficient way. In this time, the farmers can also involve themselves in other secondary jobs and improve their source of income and experience a better living. The app is free of cost and the it would be tried to make the Farming system available soon in the Agricultural departments.
